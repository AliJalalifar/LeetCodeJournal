A Journal of my coding exercises to understand data structure and algorithms and also practice leetcode problems.



<b>graph.py</b>

- Implemented a Graph class with a couple of utility functions such as bfs,dfs, and has_path.

<i>Notes</i>:
1. The best analogy I found for BFS and DFS is chess. If you think about your next move and then analyze every possible movement after your move until it's checkmate that's depth-first search. On the other hand, if you think about a move and predict opponent's response and then immidietly think about another move, that's bredth-first search.
